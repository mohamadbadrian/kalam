# kalam
Kalam is an Iranian Wordle style game made for Android. This game has good tips for learning the JavaScript language and working with the React Native framework.
The words of the game consist of a file of several thousand words, which may be able to add better words to the game with the help of artificial intelligence.
In newer versions, I would like to make the game more difficult
